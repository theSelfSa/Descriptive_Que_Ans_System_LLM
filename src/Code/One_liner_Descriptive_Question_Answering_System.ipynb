Turing proposed a simple device that he called \"Universal Computing machine\" and that is now known as a universal Turing machine.'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":103}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"id":"8yLK1a6bIQ59","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622869972729,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":5,"user":{"displayName":"akash kore","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjKcgsbG_8u9Tcr4KaqAr83Taz1bnUMlNSOgOV4fw=s64","userId":"12000294337081186743"}},"outputId":"71b0d3bf-a71d-4783-f43d-8cb6602aad2e"},"source":["answer"],"execution_count":104,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'Charles Babbage'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":104}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"1hSeguIdIQ9_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622869974392,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"akash kore","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjKcgsbG_8u9Tcr4KaqAr83Taz1bnUMlNSOgOV4fw=s64","userId":"12000294337081186743"}},"outputId":"952285ef-c63f-4ba7-efd3-376d85f4b193"},"source":["duration"],"execution_count":105,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["12.612695"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":105}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"YUvtaMXg2Xz7","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622869995631,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":11647,"user":{"displayName":"akash kore","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjKcgsbG_8u9Tcr4KaqAr83Taz1bnUMlNSOgOV4fw=s64","userId":"12000294337081186743"}},"outputId":"f2af6e9a-b8bd-4a6e-979c-15d068d123d6"},"source":["question = \"What is newtons second law of motion?\"\n","source = \"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion\"  \n","\n","answer,final_answer,duration = dquas_with_paraRanking_with_new_rule(question,source)"],"execution_count":106,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.19452\n","['newtons second law motion', 'the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied', 'newtons second law motion the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied', 'the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied newtons second law motion']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"1HTvBCsh2X4c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":124},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1622870000031,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":425,"user":{"displayName":"akash kore","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GjKcgsbG_8u9Tcr4KaqAr83Taz1bnUMlNSOgOV4fw=s64","userId":"12000294337081186743"}},"outputId":"b36383c8-c72f-4094-daab-8a816874e0eb"},"source":["final_answer\n"],"execution_count":107,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["\" The second law states that the rate of change of momentum of a body over time is directly proportional to the force applied, and occurs in the same direction as the applied force.

Some straightforward applications of natural language processing include information retrieval, text mining, question answering and machine translation. A sufficiently powerful natural language processing system would enable natural-language user interfaces and the acquisition of knowledge directly from human-written sources, such as newswire texts. Colloquially, the term \"artificial intelligence\" is often used to describe machines that mimic \"cognitive\" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as \"learning\" and \"problem solving\". For example, even specific straightforward tasks, like machine translation, require that a machine read and write in both languages (NLP), follow the author's argument (reason), know what is being talked about (knowledge), and faithfully reproduce the author's original intent (social intelligence). A problem like machine translation is considered \"AI-complete\", because all of these problems need to be solved simultaneously in order to reach human-level machine performance.\n","\n","Question - 2  is Answered with para ranking in  12.734063  Seconds\n","\n","Started with Question - 3\n","\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.624242\n","['artificial intelligence', 'intelligence demonstrated by machines', 'artificial intelligence intelligence demonstrated by machines', 'intelligence demonstrated by machines artificial intelligence']\n","\n","Final Descriptive answer:  The overall research goal of artificial intelligence is to create technology that allows computers and machines to function in an intelligent manner.

A modern operating system provides access to a number of resources, which are available to software running on the system, and to external devices like networks via the kernel. A device driver is a specific type of computer software developed to allow interaction with hardware devices. Executing an application program involves the creation of a process by the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other resources, establishes a priority for the process in multi-tasking systems, loads program binary code into memory, and initiates execution of the application program which then interacts with the user and with hardware devices.

Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs. Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent. Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs. Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions.

Dynamic memory allocation is performed using pointers. Pointers can be manipulated using assignment or pointer arithmetic. Pointers to functions are useful for passing functions as arguments to higher-order functions (such as qsort or bsearch) or as callbacks to be invoked by event handlers.

The phrase regular expressions, or regexes, is often used to mean the specific, standard textual syntax for representing patterns for matching text, as distinct from the mathematical notation described below. Each character in a regular expression (that is, each character in the string describing its pattern) is either a metacharacter, having a special meaning, or a regular character that has a literal meaning. Given regular expressions R and S, the following operations over them are definedto produce regular expressions: Regular expressions describe regular languages in formal language theory. Together, metacharacters and literal characters can be used to identify text of a given pattern or process a number of instances of it.

The output of a compiler may be executed by hardware or a program called an interpreter. The meaning given to a combination of symbols is handled by semantics (either formal or hard-coded in a reference implementation). A programming language specification can take several forms, including the following: Using natural language as an example, it may not be possible to assign a meaning to a grammatically correct sentence or the sentence may be false: The description of a programming language is usually split into the two components of syntax (form) and semantics (meaning).

The most common application of the Monte Carlo method is Monte Carlo integration. Sawilowsky distinguishes between a simulation, a Monte Carlo method, and a Monte Carlo simulation: a simulation is a fictitious representation of reality, a Monte Carlo method is a technique that can be used to solve a mathematical or statistical problem, and a Monte Carlo simulation uses repeated sampling to obtain the statistical properties of some phenomenon (or behavior). Monte Carlo simulations invert this approach, solving deterministic problems using probabilistic metaheuristics (see simulated annealing).

Unlike high-level languages, there is a one-to-one correspondence between many simple assembly statements and machine language instructions. Assembly language may also be called symbolic machine code. There are some situations in which developers might choose to use assembly language: Assembly code is converted into executable machine code by a utility program referred to as an assembler. Since the information about pseudoinstructions and macros defined in the assembler environment is not present in the object program, a disassembler cannot reconstruct the macro and pseudoinstruction invocations but can only disassemble the actual machine instructions that the assembler generated from those abstract assembly-language entities. Assembly language usually has one statement per machine instruction (1:1), but comments and statements that are assembler directives, macros, and symbolic labels of program and memory locations are often also supported. The conversion process is referred to as assembly, as in assembling the source code. Because assembly depends on the machine code instructions, every assembly language is designed for exactly one specific computer architecture.

Turing then asks: Turing did not explicitly state that the Turing test could be used as a measure of intelligence, or any other human quality. The challenge would be for the computer to be able to determine if it were interacting with a human or another computer. It tests only whether the computer behaves like a human being. Turing's new question is: \"Are there imaginable digital computers which would do well in the imitation game?\" Alan Turing used the imitation game to answer the question, \"Can a machine think?\". This is an extension of the original question that Turing attempted to answer but would, perhaps, offer a high enough standard to define a machine that could \"think\" in a way that we typically define as characteristically human. This question, Turing believed, is one that can actually be answered. \"Computing Machinery and Intelligence\" (1950) was the first published paper by Turing to focus exclusively on machine intelligence. In Turing's report, \"Intelligent Machinery\", he investigated \"the question of whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour\" and, as part of that investigation, proposed what may be considered the forerunner to his later tests: The \"Total Turing test\" variation of the Turing test, proposed by cognitive scientist Stevan Harnad, adds two further requirements to the traditional Turing test.\n","\n","Question - 71  is Answered with para ranking in  12.077639  Seconds\n","\n","Started with Question - 72\n","\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.613337\n","['explain chinese room', 'the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine can think', 'explain chinese room the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine can think', 'the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine can think explain chinese room']\n","\n","Final Descriptive answer:  John Searle's 1980 paper Minds, Brains, and Programs proposed the \"Chinese room\" thought experiment and argued that the Turing test could not be used to determine if a machine can think.

The main disadvantages of using data compression as a test are: Turing did not explicitly state that the Turing test could be used as a measure of intelligence, or any other human quality. John Searle has argued that external behaviour cannot be used to determine if a machine is \"actually\" thinking or merely \"simulating thinking.\" The philosophy of mind, psychology, and modern neuroscience have been unable to provide definitions of \"intelligence\" and \"thinking\" that are sufficiently precise and general to be applied to machines.

One or more cryptographic primitives are often used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Typical examples of cryptographic primitives include pseudorandom functions, one-way functions, etc. These primitives provide fundamental properties, which are used to develop more complex tools called cryptosystems or cryptographic protocols, which guarantee one or more high-level security properties. A cipher (or cypher) is a pair of algorithms that carry out the encryption and the reversing decryption. More complicated cryptographic tools are then built from these basic primitives. is called cryptolinguistics. If a cryptanalyst has access to, for example, the amount of time the device took to encrypt a number of plaintexts or report an error in a password or PIN character, he may be able to use a timing attack to break a cipher that is otherwise resistant to analysis. In formal mathematical terms, a \"cryptosystem\" is the ordered list of elements of finite possible plaintexts, finite possible cyphertexts, finite possible keys, and the encryption and decryption algorithms which correspond to each key. Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols.

Finding the optimal solution to the k-means clustering problem for observations in d dimensions is: k-means clustering is a method of vector quantization, originally from signal processing, that aims to partition n observations into k clusters in which each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean (cluster centers or cluster centroid), serving as a prototype of the cluster. The centroid of each of the k clusters becomes the new mean. 2. k clusters are created by associating every observation with the nearest mean. The algorithm is often presented as assigning objects to the nearest cluster by distance. k-means clustering has been used as a feature learning (or dictionary learning) step, in either (semi-)supervised learning or unsupervised learning. The set of squared error minimizing cluster functions also includes the k-medoids algorithm, an approach which forces the center point of each cluster to be one of the actual points, i.e., it uses medoids in place of centroids.\n","\n","Question - 81  is Answered with para ranking in  11.569605  Seconds\n","\n","Started with Question - 82\n","\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.334591\n","['explain feature learning using k-means clustering', 'successful application of k-means to feature learning.', 'explain feature learning using k-means clustering successful application of k-means to feature learning.', 'successful application of k-means to feature learning. explain feature learning using k-means clustering']\n","\n","Final Descriptive answer:  This aids in explaining the successful application of k-means to feature learning. This use of k-means has been successfully combined with simple, linear classifiers for semi-supervised learning in NLP (specifically for named entity recognition) and in computer vision. k-means clustering has been used as a feature learning (or dictionary learning) step, in either (semi-)supervised learning or unsupervised learning. The basic approach is first to train a k-means clustering representation, using the input training data (which need not be labelled). In cluster analysis, the k-means algorithm can be used to partition the input data set into k partitions (clusters). On an object recognition task, it was found to exhibit comparable performance with more sophisticated feature learning approaches such as autoencoders and restricted Boltzmann machines. k-means originates from signal processing, and still finds use in this domain.\n","\n","Question - 82  is Answered with para ranking in  11.855074  Seconds\n","\n","Started with Question - 83\n","\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.33045\n","['unix', 'a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems', 'unix a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems', 'a family of multitasking, multiuser computer operating systems unix']\n","\n","Final Descriptive answer:  Unix operating systems are widely used in modern servers, workstations, and mobile devices.

The names and filesystem locations of the Unix components have changed substantially across the history of the system. Unix systems are characterized by various concepts: the use of plain text for storing data; a hierarchical file system; treating devices and certain types of inter-process communication (IPC) as files; and the use of a large number of software tools, small programs that can be strung together through a command-line interpreter using pipes, as opposed to using a single monolithic program that includes all of the same functionality.

Later, Unix gradually gained portability, multi-tasking and multi-user capabilities in a time-sharing configuration. During the late 1970s and early 1980s, the influence of Unix in academic circles led to large-scale adoption of Unix (BSD and System V) by commercial startups, which in turn led to Unix fragmenting into multiple, similar but often slightly mutually-incompatible systems including DYNIX, HP-UX, SunOS/Solaris, AIX, and Xenix. Although this followed the lead of Multics and Burroughs, it was Unix that popularized the idea. At first, Unix was not designed to be portable or for multi-tasking. The origins of Unix date back to the mid-1960s when the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell Labs, and General Electric were developing Multics, a time-sharing operating system for the GE-645 mainframe computer.Multics featured several innovations, but also presented severe problems.\n","\n","Question - 84  is Answered with para ranking in  11.729442  Seconds\n","\n","Started with Question - 85\n","\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.398539\n","['c sharp', 'MUSIC SHARP SIGN', 'c sharp MUSIC SHARP SIGN', 'MUSIC SHARP SIGN c sharp']\n","\n","Final Descriptive answer: This is a Partially Correct answer (Only for information purpose): The name \"C sharp\" was inspired by the musical notation whereby a sharp symbol indicates that the written note should be made a semitone higher in pitch.This is similar to the language name of C++, where \"++\" indicates that a variable should be incremented by 1 after being evaluated. and the fact that the sharp symbol (.mw-parser-output .monospaced{font-family:monospace,monospace}U+266F ♯ MUSIC SHARP SIGN (HTML &#9839; · &sharp;)) is not present on most keyboard layouts, the number sign (U+0023 # NUMBER SIGN (HTML &#35; · &num;)) was chosen to approximate the sharp symbol in the written name of the programming language.This convention is reflected in the ECMA-334 C# Language Specification.

A floating-point number is a rational number, because it can be represented as one integer divided by another; for example 1.45×103 is (145/100)×1000 or 145,000/100. However, there are alternatives: A number representation specifies some way of encoding a number, usually as a string of digits. If there is not an exact representation then the conversion requires a choice of which floating-point number to use to represent the original value. The number of normalized floating-point numbers in a system (B, P, L, U) where Historically, several number bases have been used for representing floating-point numbers, with base two (binary) being the most common, followed by base ten (decimal floating point), and other less common varieties, such as base sixteen (hexadecimal floating point[nb 3]), base eight (octal floating point[nb 4]), base four (quaternary floating point[nb 5]), base three (balanced ternary floating point) and even base 256[nb 6] and base 65,536.

Binary search compares the target value to the middle element of the array. Binary search begins by comparing an element in the middle of the array with the target value. For example, binary search can be used to compute, for a given value, its rank (the number of smaller elements), predecessor (next-smallest element), successor (next-largest element), and nearest neighbor. The binary search tree and B-tree data structures are based on binary search. A binary search tree is a binary tree data structure that works based on the principle of binary search. If the target value matches the element, its position in the array is returned. The standard binary search algorithm is simply the case where the graph is a path.

A color in the RGB color model is described by indicating how much of each of the red, green, and blue is included. To form a color with RGB, three light beams (one red, one green, and one blue) must be superimposed (for example by emission from a black screen or by reflection from a white screen). RGB is a device-dependent color model: different devices detect or reproduce a given RGB value differently, since the color elements (such as phosphors or dyes) and their response to the individual R, G, and B levels vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, or even in the same device over time. This article discusses concepts common to all the different color spaces that use the RGB color model, which are used in one implementation or another in color image-producing technology. The RGB color model is one of the most common ways to encode color in computing, and several different binary digital representations are in use. The RGB color model itself does not define what is meant by red, green, and blue colorimetrically, and so the results of mixing them are not specified as absolute, but relative to the primary colors. Encodings of 1, 2, 4, 5, 8 and 16 bits per color are commonly found; the total number of bits used for an RGB color is typically called the color depth. Thus an RGB value does not define the same color across devices without some kind of color management. For example, brightest saturated red is written in the different RGB notations as: Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras. Each of the three beams is called a component of that color, and each of them can have an arbitrary intensity, from fully off to fully on, in the mixture.\n","\n","Question - 117  is Answered with para ranking in  11.451806  Seconds\n","\n","Started with Question - 118\n","\n","TIME TAKEN BY STSB PARAGRAPH RANKING :  0.401189\n","['rgb devices', 'color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras', 'rgb devices color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras', 'color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras rgb devices']\n","\n","Final Descriptive answer:  Typical RGB input devices are color TV and video cameras, image scanners, and digital cameras.
